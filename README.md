from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Features and target
X = np.array([
    [2, 80, 50],
    [3, 60, 40],
    [5, 90, 70],
    [7, 85, 80],
    [9, 95, 90]
])
y = np.array([50, 45, 70, 80, 95])

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Create SGD Regressor
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, learning_rate='invscaling', eta0=0.01, random_state=42)
sgd_reg.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Coefficients and intercept
print("Weights (coefficients):", sgd_reg.coef_)
print("Intercept:", sgd_reg.intercept_)

# Predictions
y_pred = sgd_reg.predict(X_scaled)
print("Predicted values:", y_pred)
